# Small Programming Language

S-Lang (Small Language) - a small, pascal-like programming language. This is my experiments with programming languages and compilers.

### Compiler
The source code of compiler, without build system. This repository should have no any external dependency (except RTL and compiler for this compiler).

### Doc
The external (public) documentation for the compiler and the S-Lang. Currently, all documentation is presented in the Markdown format.

### Lang
The S-Lang design and internal documentations and specifications. All the work on language design should be done here.

### RTL
The S-Lang Run-Time Library (or RTL) is composed of a number of base units that provide the underlying support for S-Lang compiler and most programs and components. The RTL includes global routines, utility classes, basic and additional (abstract) data types definitions, etc. [Browse source...](./rtl/)

### Tests
The testing infrastructure and test cases.

### Tools
Any external tools (binaries).

### VCL
The Visual Component Library of the S-Lang.

### Web
The source code of S-Lang website.
